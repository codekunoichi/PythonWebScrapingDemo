# Scraping any URL with Requests and Beautiful Soup

- We will install the packages into a virtual environment
- Virtual Environment can be installed using the following command
- `pip install virtualenv`
- You can use `pip list` to review all installed packages
- Initialize a virtual environment folder called `env`
- `virtualenv env` - This creates a new `env` folder
- `ls -la env` lists content of the env folder
- `source env/bin/activate` Use this command to activate the virtual Environment
- Check using `which python` to see the python used is from the virtual Environment.

# Install requests and beautiful soup packages

- `pip install requests`
- `pip install bs4`
- `pip install lxml`

# Before you begin coding the Scraping jobs

- Study the DOM using chrome developer tools - inspect element.
- Identify the HTML tags which needs to be parsed
- Identify the CSS class which can help narrow the section to parse and collect the necessary information.

# Demo choices and important code snippets

Facebook careers Page URL is `'https://www.facebook.com/careers/jobs/'`

Reviewing facebook careers page, I was able to identify the pattern in which the job listing were stored. Following are snippets copied using the Chrome Developer Tools.

```
#search_result > div._8tk7
```

```
#search_result > div._8tk7 > a:nth-child(1)
```

Leading to the following important code snippets

```
links = soup.find('div', {'class': '_8tk7'}).findAll('a')
```

- Using the links, iterate to extract the link text and URL.
- Place it in a dictionary.

```
def get_job_listing(url):
    req = requests.get(url)

    soup = BeautifulSoup(req.text, 'lxml')

    links = soup.find('div', {'class': '_8tk7'}).findAll('a')

    for link in links:
        job_details = dict()
        job_details['name'] = link.text
        job_details['href'] = link['href']
        print(job_details)
```

# To run the webscraper_demo

```
python webscraper_demo.py
```

The extraction of minimum and preferred qualification output from a single URL would look like:

```
{ 'minimum': [ '8+ years of experience in organizational design, change '
               'management, leadership and development, or other relevant '
               'fields',

# Room for improvement

- catch connection errors such as MaxRetryErrors, Failure to Connect etc.
